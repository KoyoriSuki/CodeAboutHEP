# Transformer model used for the classification task

## Installation

-This model is built upon the set transformer. The modules need to be downloaded from https://github.com/juho-lee/set_transformer. Then copy all files and folders from this directory to the path where max_regression_demo.ipynb locates.
-To run the .ipynb files, Jupyter Notebook is required. Alternatively, you can copy all the code blocks from the .ipynb file to a .py file, which should work as well.
-This model was initially developed using PyTorch v2.0.1.
